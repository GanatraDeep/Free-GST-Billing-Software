/*
 * v1.10.83 (#112) - cost centres: tag a bill, purchase or expense with a
 * branch, site or project, then see sales, purchases, expenses and profit
 * for each one.
 *
 * Requested: "There is no Cost center management for Project or Branch".
 * One cost centre per document, kept simple on purpose: splitting one bill
 * across two sites is a different (and much bigger) feature.
 *
 * The list lives in meta.json as `costCentres`: [{ id, name, code, archived,
 * business }]. `business` is businessKeyOf() of the business it belongs to;
 * a centre with none shows under every business, the same rule
 * belongsToProfile() uses for records that cannot be attributed.
 *
 * A document stores `costCentre` (the id) and `costCentreName` (the name when
 * it was tagged), so a rename or archive never blanks an old document.
 * Invoices keep both in data.details (they travel with the rest of the
 * invoice details: drafts, edits, duplicates); purchases and expenses keep
 * them on the record itself.
