/*
 * v1.10.83 (#123) - payments to suppliers on a purchase bill.
 *
 * Asked for: "vendor payment entry, how to enter for purchase invoice". A bill
 * keeps purchase.payments[] ({ id, amount, date, mode, reference, note,
 * recordedAt, auto? }), like sales invoices keep bill.payments[].
 *
 * What is owed is the bill total less the TDS you keep back ("Paid to
 * supplier"). The status follows the payments: Paid, Partial (shown as "Partly
 * paid") or Unpaid. A bill saved before this, with no payments, keeps the
 * status it was given, so an old bill marked Paid stays Paid.
 *
 * "Mark as paid" records one payment for the balance (mode Other, auto: true),
 * as invoices do; Unpaid takes that payment back and keeps the ones you
 * entered. Mode Other keeps it out of the cash book: how it was paid is unknown.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no storage, so the server checks with the same rules.
