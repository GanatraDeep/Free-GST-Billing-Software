# Divtech Hisaab - the app's Desktop / Start Menu icon (v1.10.83).
# Dot-sourced by install-windows.ps1 and start-windows.ps1. install.ps1 (the
# one-line install) has its own copy of New-AppShortcut: keep the two alike.
#
# The icon opens the app itself: start-windows.ps1 starts the server when it
# is not running and opens the app in its own window. The console is
# minimised and then hidden, so all that shows is the app (-Hidden puts a
# problem on screen if there is one).
