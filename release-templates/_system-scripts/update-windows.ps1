# Divtech Hisaab - Windows updater.
#
# Pulls the latest release ZIP from GitHub, extracts _system/ over
# the existing one, re-runs npm install. Data folder is preserved.
#
# Design decisions:
#   * Data folder never touched - user's invoices survive updates
#   * We fetch by tag_name from GitHub Releases so users always get
#     the latest published release, not a random dev commit
#   * Pre-update, we snapshot data/ to a timestamped backup as a
#     safety net - even though we don't touch data, hardware faults
#     during rmdir could corrupt state
#   * v1.10.75 - -InstallTo <installed app folder>: run from a newly
#     extracted ZIP, this updates THAT install from the files in this ZIP,
#     with no download. It works offline and does not depend on the older
#     copy's own updater. The launcher uses it when it finds the app already
#     installed elsewhere, instead of installing a second copy.
