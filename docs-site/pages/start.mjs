<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>Divtech Hisaab is invoicing and GST software for small businesses in India, and for anyone billing in other currencies: 20 are supported. It runs on your computer and opens in your web browser, the way a website does, but nothing leaves your machine.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Invoices</strong>: tax invoices, bills of supply, proforma estimates, credit notes and delivery challans, with CGST, SGST, IGST and UTGST worked out for you.</li>
  <li><strong>Getting paid</strong>: record payments, print receipts, see who is overdue and by how much.</li>
  <li><strong>GST returns</strong>: GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B built from your invoices and purchases, as files you upload to the GST portal.</li>
  <li><strong>The rest of the books</strong>: clients, products and stock, purchases, expenses, recurring invoices, profit and loss, and an income tax calculator.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="requirements">
<h2>What you need</h2>
<table>
  <tr><th>Computer</th><td>Windows 10 or 11, macOS, or Linux (a NAS works too).</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Browser</th><td>Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Brave. The app opens in it.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Disk space</th><td>Roughly 200 MB once installed.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Internet</th><td>Only for the first install and for updates. Everything else works offline.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Account or signup</th><td>None.</td></tr>
</table>
</section>

<section id="your-data">
<h2>Where your data lives</h2>
<p>Every invoice, client and setting is saved as plain files inside the app's folder, in <code>_system\\data</code>. They never leave your computer unless you turn on Google Drive backup yourself.</p>
<p>That also means backing up is your job, and it is easy. See <a href="backup.html">Backups, updates and moving PC</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="is-it-free">
<h2>Do I need a subscription?</h2>
<p>Only for updates. Everything in the app works without one, and nothing is locked. A subscription from Divtech brings every new update released while it is active: new features, GST changes and fixes. See <a href="support.html">Support &amp; Subscription</a>. Is it safe? See <a href="security.html">Security and privacy</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="get-help">
<h2>Getting help</h2>
<p>Every screen in the app with a ${ui('?')} button links to the matching part of these pages. If something is missing here, or the app does something these pages don't describe, tell Divtech on <a href="https://wa.me/919429911067">WhatsApp (+91 94299 11067)</a> or at <a href="mailto:hello@divtech.in">hello@divtech.in</a> with a screenshot.</p>

  body: `
<section id="welcome">
<h2>Step 1 of the welcome: where you invoice from</h2>
<p>The first screen explains what the app does, and asks <b>Where will you be invoicing from?</b></p>
<p>A small <b>Safe and private</b> box on it sums up how your data is kept: on this computer, with no account, working offline. Its ${ui('How we keep it safe')} link opens <a href="security.html">Is it safe? Security and privacy</a>.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td>🇮🇳 India</td><td>GST, GSTR-1 and 3B, UPI. The default.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>🌍 Outside India</td><td>VAT and other local taxes</td></tr>
  <tr><td>🌐 Both</td><td>India, with clients abroad</td></tr>
</table>
<p>${ui('Get Started')} carries on. ${ui('Skip Setup')} goes straight to the app; fill in <a href="settings.html#company-details">Settings</a> later.</p>
</section>

<section id="business-details">
<h2>Step 2: business details</h2>
<p>These print at the top of every invoice. Only the <b>Business Name</b> is required.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td>Business Name</td><td>Required</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Address</td><td>Your full address</td></tr>
  <tr><td>State</td><td>Needed to work out CGST and SGST versus IGST</td></tr>
  <tr><td>GSTIN</td><td>Leave blank if you are not registered</td></tr>
  <tr><td>PAN, Phone, Email</td><td>Optional</td></tr>
</table>
<p>${ui('Next')} stays greyed out until a Business Name is typed. ${ui('Back')} returns to the first screen without losing what you typed.</p>
<div class="note tip"><strong>Getting it right</strong>
<p><b>State</b> is where your business is registered. The app compares it with each client's state: same state means CGST + SGST, a different state means IGST. A wrong state here makes the tax wrong on every invoice.</p>
<p><b>GSTIN</b> is your 15-character GST number, for example <code>07ABCDE1234F1Z5</code>. Its first two digits are your state code. Not registered for GST? Leave it blank; you can make bills without GST. Everything here can be changed later in <a href="settings.html#company-details">Settings → Company details</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Not sure whether you need GST registration, or which scheme to choose? See <a href="gst-basics.html#registration">GST basics: do I need GST registration?</a></p>
</section>

<section id="bank-upi">
<h2>Step 3: bank and UPI</h2>
<p>Where clients should pay you: bank name, account number, IFSC code and UPI ID. A UPI ID puts a scan-to-pay QR code on your invoices. You can also upload your logo and signature here, up to 500 KB each, and choose <b>Show my business name and logo in the app's menu</b> (ticked to start; change it any time in <a href="settings.html#branding">Settings → Company → Branding</a>). ${ui('Skip, I’ll add later')} leaves it all for <a href="settings.html#payment-accounts">Settings</a>.</p>
<div class="note tip"><strong>Something wrong?</strong>
<p><b>"Image must be under 500KB".</b> The logo or signature file is too big. Open it in Paint (or any photo app), make it smaller, save it as PNG or JPG, and choose it again.</p>
<p><b>A typing mistake in the account number or IFSC.</b> Check them against your passbook or cheque book; they print on every invoice. You can correct them later in <a href="settings.html#payment-accounts">Settings → Payment accounts</a>.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section id="all-set">
<h2>Step 4: you're all set</h2>
<p>A short list of what to do next: make your first invoice, download or share it, check the GST reports, and file your returns. ${ui('Start Billing')} saves everything; your bank details become your first <a href="settings.html#payment-accounts">payment account</a>. You see <b>Setup complete! Start creating invoices.</b> and the app opens.</p>
<p>If you see <b>Failed to save. Try again.</b>, the app's engine stopped: check it is still running (see <a href="troubleshooting.html#cannot-connect">Failed to fetch</a>) and click ${ui('Start Billing')} again.</p>
<p>Next: <a href="first-invoice.html">make your first invoice</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="setup-wizard">
<h2>Then: setting up your invoices</h2>
<p>Next, a three-step window sets up printing.</p>
<ol class="steps">
  <li><strong>What kind of business do you run?</strong>Pick one: Retail shop / kirana, Freelancer / consultant, Restaurant / cafe, Wholesale / trading, Manufacturing, Service / repair shop, or Everything. It decides which features the app shows: a freelancer, for example, does not see Products or Purchases. See <a href="settings.html#business-type">Business type</a> for what each one shows and hides; nothing is deleted, and you can change it any time in Settings. It also sets an invoice style to match (see <a href="print-settings.html#business-type">Print and PDF: business type</a>). Or choose <b>None of these</b> to keep every feature as it is and set things up yourself.</li>
  <li><strong>Paper size and language</strong>Pick what you mostly print on: A4, A5, 80 mm or 58 mm thermal. It becomes the paper size of new invoices. Then the language for section labels such as BILL TO: English, Hindi, Tamil, Marathi or Bengali.</li>
  <li><strong>Ready to go</strong>A summary of your choices. ${ui('Finish setup')} applies them.</li>
</ol>
<p>${ui('Skip setup')}, or the ${ui('✕')}, closes it. A ${ui('✨ Finish setup')} button then waits at the bottom right of the screen, for whenever you want to come back to it. Everything it sets can also be changed in <a href="print-settings.html">Print and PDF settings</a>.</p>
<p>The top of the window shows <b>Step 1 of 3</b> and a bar that fills as you go. ${ui('Continue')} moves on, ${ui('Back')} goes back without losing your choices.</p>
</section>

<section id="wizard-business-type">
<h3>What kind of business do you run?</h3>
<p>Click the card that fits you best; it turns blue. Each card has a one-line hint:</p>
<div class="table-wrap"><table>
  <tr><th>Card</th><th>For</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Retail shop / kirana</td><td>Selling from a counter, keeping stock, buying from suppliers.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Freelancer / consultant</td><td>Billing for your time or services, no stock.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Restaurant / cafe</td><td>Quick bills, UPI payments, buying supplies.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Wholesale / trading</td><td>Buying and selling goods in bulk and sending them with e-way bills.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Manufacturing</td><td>Making products from raw material.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Service / repair shop</td><td>Repairs and services, spare parts in stock, yearly contracts.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Everything</td><td>Every feature the app has.</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Your choice decides which screens the sidebar shows and sets a matching invoice style. Hidden screens are only hidden: nothing is deleted, and you can switch any feature back on later in <a href="settings.html#features">Settings → Features</a> or change the type in <a href="settings.html#business-type">Settings → Business type</a>.</p>
<p>${ui("None of these — I'll configure manually")} closes the window at once and changes nothing: every feature stays as it is, and the ✨ Finish setup button does not appear.</p>
<div class="note tip"><strong>Not sure?</strong>
<p>Pick the one closest to what you do most. A shop that also repairs things can pick Retail shop / kirana. If you want to see everything first, pick <b>Everything</b> and hide what you do not use later.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section id="wizard-paper-language">
<h3>Paper size + language</h3>
<p><b>Paper size</b>: what you mostly print on. It becomes the paper size of every new invoice; you can still change it on any one invoice.</p>
<div class="table-wrap"><table>
  <tr><td>A4 · Standard</td><td>Normal office paper and laser or inkjet printers. The usual choice.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>A5 · Compact</td><td>Half of A4. For short bills.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>80mm Thermal</td><td>The common shop receipt printer (about 8 cm wide roll).</td></tr>
  <tr><td>58mm Thermal</td><td>Small receipt printers (about 6 cm wide roll).</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Not sure which thermal printer you have? Measure the paper roll, or see <a href="thermal-printing.html#setup">Thermal printing</a>.</p>
<p><b>Section label language</b>: the language of the printed headings such as BILL TO and TOTAL: English, हिन्दी (Hindi), தமிழ் (Tamil), मराठी (Marathi) or বাংলা (Bengali). Your item names, addresses and the rest stay exactly as you type them; the app's own screens stay in English.</p>
</section>

<section id="wizard-ready">
<h3>Ready to go</h3>
<p>A summary of the three choices: <b>Business type</b>, <b>Default paper size</b> and <b>Section label language</b>. Check them, then click ${ui('Finish setup')}. You see <b>Setup complete! Your defaults are configured.</b> and land on the Dashboard. Your next new invoice uses these settings.</p>
<div class="note tip"><strong>Something wrong?</strong>
<p><b>A screen I need is missing from the sidebar.</b> Your business type hid it. Turn it back on in <a href="settings.html#features">Settings → Features</a>.</p>
<p><b>Invoices print on the wrong paper.</b> Change the paper size on the invoice (<a href="invoice-options.html#paper-size">Paper / print size</a>), or the default in <a href="print-settings.html">Print and PDF settings</a>.</p>

<section id="before-you-start">
<h2>Before you start</h2>
<p>Have these to hand: your business name, address and GSTIN, and your bank account or UPI ID if you want clients to pay you directly from the invoice. None of it is compulsory, and all of it can be added later.</p>
</section>

<section id="walkthrough">
<h2>Make the invoice</h2>
<ol class="steps">
  <li><strong>Add your business details</strong>If you skipped the welcome, open ${ui('Settings')} and fill in <b>Company Details</b>. This is the header of every invoice. Your state matters: it decides whether GST is split into CGST and SGST, or charged as IGST.</li>
  <li><strong>Start a new invoice</strong>Click ${ui('New Invoice')} in the sidebar. <b>Tax Invoice</b> is already selected, which is the right choice for a normal GST sale.</li>
  <li><strong>Add the client</strong>Under <b>Billed To</b>, type the client's name. If they are registered for GST, type their GSTIN and their state fills in by itself. A mistyped GSTIN is caught straight away.</li>
  <li><strong>Add what you sold</strong>For each line, give a description, quantity, unit, rate and GST rate. The HSN or SAC code is optional but helps your GST return. Not sure which rate or code? See <a href="gst-basics.html#which-rate">What GST rate do I charge?</a> and <a href="gst-basics.html#hsn-search">finding your HSN or SAC code</a>. Clicking a number field selects what is there, so you can just type.</li>
  <li><strong>Check the tax</strong>The preview on the right shows the totals. Same state as you: CGST and SGST. Another state: IGST. You do not need to choose.</li>
  <li><strong>Save and download</strong>Click ${ui('Save &amp; Download')}. The invoice gets its number, is saved to your records, and downloads as a PDF.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="send">
<h2>Send it</h2>
<ul>
  <li>${ui('WhatsApp')} opens a message to the client. On a phone the PDF is attached for you; on a computer, WhatsApp does not let websites attach files, so download the PDF and drag it into the chat.</li>
  <li>${ui('Print')} opens your printer directly, including thermal receipt printers.</li>
  <li>Or attach the downloaded PDF to an email yourself.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="get-paid">
<h2>When the client pays</h2>
<p>On the <a href="dashboard.html">Dashboard</a>, find the invoice and record the payment. A printable receipt opens straight away, and the invoice's status changes to <b>Partial</b> or <b>Paid</b>. Unpaid invoices past their due date are marked <b>Overdue</b> for you.</p>
</section>

<section id="whats-next">
<h2>What to do next</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="products.html">Add your products and services</a>, so you pick them from a list instead of typing them each time.</li>
  <li><a href="settings.html#payment-accounts">Add your bank or UPI</a>, so a payment QR code prints on every invoice.</li>
  <li><a href="settings.html#branding">Add your logo, signature and stamp</a>.</li>
